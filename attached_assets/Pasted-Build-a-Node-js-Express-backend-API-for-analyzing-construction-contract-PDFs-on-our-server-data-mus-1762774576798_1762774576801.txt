Build a Node.js/Express backend API for analyzing construction contract PDFs on our server (data must NOT leave our servers).

REQUIREMENTS:

1. CREATE ENDPOINT: POST /api/analyze-contract
   - Accept PDF file upload
   - Extract text from PDF on our server using pdf-parse
   - Parse and count definitions
   - Parse and count numbered clause headings
   - Store results in database (use SQLite for now)
   - Return JSON with counts and lists

2. DEFINITION EXTRACTION PATTERNS:
   Identify definitions common in Australian construction contracts:
   - Quoted terms followed by "means" or "includes"
   - Terms in CAPITALS defined in definition clauses
   - Pattern: "Term" means...
   - Pattern: In this Contract, "Term" means...
   - Pattern: TERM means...
   - Common in AS4000, AS4300, AS4902, AS4917 contracts

3. NUMBERED HEADING EXTRACTION:
   Match Australian construction contract numbering:
   - Single level: 1, 2, 3
   - Multi-level: 1.1, 2.3.4, 10.2.1
   - Format: [number] [HEADING TEXT]
   - Ignore page numbers and references

4. DATABASE SCHEMA:
   Table: contract_analyses
   - id (auto)
   - filename
   - upload_date
   - definition_count
   - heading_count
   - definitions (JSON array)
   - headings (JSON array)
   - full_text (stored encrypted)

5. REACT FRONTEND:
   - File upload component
   - Display loading state
   - Show results: counts + expandable lists
   - Clean UI for construction professionals

6. SECURITY:
   - Validate file is PDF
   - Limit file size to 50MB
   - Rate limiting on endpoint
   - No data sent to external APIs

PACKAGES TO USE:
- express
- multer (file uploads)
- pdf-parse (PDF text extraction)
- better-sqlite3 (database)
- cors

Return analysis results in this format:
{
  "success": true,
  "filename": "contract.pdf",
  "results": {
    "definitionCount": 45,
    "headingCount": 127,
    "definitions": ["Contractor", "Site", "Works", ...],
    "headings": [
      {"number": "1", "text": "INTERPRETATION"},
      {"number": "1.1", "text": "Definitions"},
      ...
    ]
  }
}

Make the extraction robust for Australian standard form contracts (AS series) and typical construction management agreements.
