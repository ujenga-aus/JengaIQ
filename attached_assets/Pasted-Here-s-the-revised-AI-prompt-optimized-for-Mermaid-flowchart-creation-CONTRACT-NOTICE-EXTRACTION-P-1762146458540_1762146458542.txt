Here's the revised AI prompt optimized for Mermaid flowchart creation:

CONTRACT NOTICE EXTRACTION PROMPT (FOR MERMAID FLOWCHART)
Task: Analyze the attached contract and create a comprehensive list of ALL notice requirements, including explicit notices, implied notice obligations, recurring notices, and the complete flow-on effects of each notice for flowchart mapping.
Instructions:

Identify ALL notice-triggering language, including but not limited to:

"Notice" / "notify" / "notification"
"Inform" / "information"
"Advise" / "advice"
"Communicate" / "communication"
"Alert"
"Report" / "reporting"
"Disclose" / "disclosure"
"Submit" / "submission"
"Provide written..." / "in writing"
"Shall give..." / "must give..."
"Warn" / "warning"
"Request" / "application"


For EACH notice requirement identified, extract:

Clause Reference: Clause number and title
Notice ID: Create a unique identifier (e.g., VAR-01, DELAY-01, TERM-01)
Trigger Event: What circumstances require the notice
Party Giving Notice: Who must provide the notice
Party Receiving Notice: Who must receive the notice
Timeframe: When the notice must be given (e.g., "immediately," "within 7 days," "prior to")
Form/Method: How it must be delivered (written, email, registered mail, etc.)
Content Requirements: What information must be included
Recurring: Is this a one-time or recurring notice? If recurring, what is the frequency?


CRITICAL: Map the complete FLOW-ON EFFECTS for each notice:

Response Required: Must the recipient respond? If yes:

Response timeframe
Response notice ID
What the response must contain


Subsequent Actions: What happens next? Include:

Decision points (approve/reject/request more info)
Alternative pathways based on responses
Follow-up notices triggered by this notice
Meetings/consultations required
Dispute resolution triggers


Consequences:

If notice given properly
If notice not given or late
If response not provided


Loop-backs: Does this notice create a cycle (e.g., notice → response → revised notice)?


Special attention to notices related to:

Variations/Change Orders
Claims/Disputes
Delays/Extensions of Time
Force Majeure events
Defects/Non-conformance
Termination/Suspension
Payment issues
Safety incidents
Site conditions
Breaches/Defaults
Insurance claims
Progress reporting (recurring)
Monthly/periodic submissions (recurring)


Output Format - TWO PARTS:

PART A: Notice Inventory Table
| Notice ID | Clause Ref | Trigger Event | Giver | Recipient | Timeframe | Method | Recurring? | Content Required |
PART B: Notice Flow Map (Pre-Mermaid Structure)
For each notice, provide:
NOTICE ID: [ID]
TRIGGER: [Event]
↓
STEP 1: [Party] gives notice within [timeframe]
↓
STEP 2: [Party] receives notice
↓
DECISION POINT: [What must recipient decide/do?]
   → Option A: [Action pathway 1]
      → Leads to: [Notice ID or outcome]
   → Option B: [Action pathway 2]
      → Leads to: [Notice ID or outcome]
   → Option C: [If no response within timeframe]
      → Leads to: [Consequence or Notice ID]
↓
LOOP: [If applicable, note any recurring cycles]
↓
END STATE: [Final outcome or ongoing process]

Create a MERMAID FLOWCHART for the 5 most complex notice chains
Use proper Mermaid syntax with:


Start/End nodes (stadium shape)
Process boxes (rectangle)
Decision diamonds
Subgraphs for each major notice chain
Clear labels and relationships

Example Mermaid format:
mermaidgraph TD
    Start([Trigger Event]) --> N1[Party A gives Notice]
    N1 --> N2{Party B Response?}
    N2 -->|Approved| N3[Work Proceeds]
    N2 -->|Rejected| N4[Party A gives Revised Notice]
    N2 -->|No Response in 7 days| N5[Deemed Approved]
    N4 --> N1
Provide summary showing:

Total notices identified
Total recurring notices
Most complex notice chains (most steps)
Critical path notices (those that trigger multiple flow-ons)
