Looking at both files, I can clearly see the significant quality difference between the web interface review (Excel) and the API review (Word document). Here's what's happening:
Key Differences
Web Interface Version (Excel) - High Quality:

Comprehensive analysis with detailed explanations (often multiple paragraphs)
Specific clause references found (e.g., "Clauses 5.3, 9.1, 9.9, 9.12")
Nuanced compliance assessments (COMPLIANT, NON-COMPLIANT, PARTIALLY COMPLIANT)
Detailed, actionable amendments with specific wording proposals
Successfully analyzed 29 contract items with substantive findings

API Version (Word) - Much Lower Quality:

Repeatedly states "No specific clauses found" for most items
Generic, templated responses that don't reflect actual contract analysis
Confused about what to analyze - many entries discuss "N/A" as if it's a contract term
Missing or minimal amendments (many just show "-")
Superficial analysis that doesn't demonstrate actual document comprehension

Likely Causes
The quality difference suggests several possible issues with your API implementation:

Document Access Problem: The contract document may not be properly accessible to the API call - it might not be in the context or might be truncated
Missing Context/Instructions: The API version might not be receiving the same detailed instructions about:

How to analyze contract clauses
What benchmark requirements mean
How to structure the analysis


Token Limits: API calls may have stricter token limits that truncate the contract document
System Prompt Differences: The web interface likely has specialized system prompts for contract analysis that your API integration isn't using
File Upload Handling: The way documents are uploaded/processed may differ between web and API

Recommendations
To improve your API implementation:

Ensure the full contract document is in the context
Provide detailed system prompts about contract analysis methodology
Check token limits and increase if needed
Consider using the same prompting strategies as the web interface
Verify that file uploads are processed correctly
