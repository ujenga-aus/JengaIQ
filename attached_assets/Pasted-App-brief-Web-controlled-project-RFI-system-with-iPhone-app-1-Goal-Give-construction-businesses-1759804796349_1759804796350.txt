App brief: Web-controlled project + RFI system with iPhone app
1) Goal

Give construction businesses a single place to:

set up a company and business units (with ABNs),

manage projects and phases,

load a “company contract benchmark” template and AI-review client contracts against it,

raise and close RFIs quickly (desktop and iPhone), with photo capture and a thread-style discussion.

2) Users and access

Roles

Admin – full access across the company.

Business Unit Manager (BUM) – full access to projects and RFIs within assigned BU(s). Can belong to multiple BUs.

Employee – access limited to projects they’re on within their BU(s).

Auth

Email + password, MFA optional.

SSO (Microsoft/Google) optional phase 2.

Password reset via email.

3) Hierarchy and entities

Level 1: Company

Fields: Company name, primary contact, address, default timezone (Australia/Brisbane), ABN (optional at company level), logo.

Import employees (CSV + UI form). Map columns to: name, email, mobile, role (Admin/BUM/Employee), BU assignments.

Level 2: Business Unit (BU)

Fields: BU name, ABN or other unique number (required), notes.

Assign users to BU(s).

Level 3: Project

Fields: Project ID, Project name, BU (lookup), Location (optional), Client, Project phase (Tender / Delivery / Close-out),

Phase dates: tender start/end, delivery start/end, close-out start/end.

Status (Active, On hold, Complete).

Attach: Contract documents, drawings, specs.

Section: Contract Benchmarks & AI Review

Upload “Company Contract Benchmark” template (structured checklist or clause library).

Upload client contract (PDF/DOCX). AI compares against benchmarks and outputs:

variance map (met / partially met / not met),

clause references and page hits,

risk flags (time/cost/scope/payment/SOPA/BIFA),

suggested drafting/negotiation notes.

Save AI report versioned per upload; link findings to project.

Section: RFIs

Project-scoped auto-increment RFI numbering starting at 1 per project (format: <ProjectID>-RFI-0001).

See fields below.

4) RFI model (desktop + iPhone)

RFI fields

RFI Number / Reference (system generated, read-only).

Date of Creation (default today).

To (Recipient): people/org contacts (lookup + free text).

Subject / Title (short).

Detailed Description / Question (rich text).

Relevant Drawing / Spec References (free text; allow multiple).

Proposed Resolution / Suggestion (rich text).

Impacted Areas (multi-select: Program, Cost, Safety, Quality; optional notes).

Required Response Date (date).

Attachments (photos, PDFs, marked-up drawings).

RFI Status: Open, Awaiting Info, Responded, Closed.

Response (rich text, with attachment support).

Date of Response (date; auto when status = Responded/Closed).

Distribution List (multi-select project team + free text emails).

Threading

Facebook-style comment thread under each RFI:

posts, replies, @mentions, timestamps, attachment per comment.

status changes visible in the thread (system notes).

edit history and versioning on the Response and Description.

Register

Desktop web shows filterable, sortable register per project:

columns: Number, Title, To, Status, Required Response Date, Days Open, Last Activity, Assignee (optional).

quick filters: My RFIs, Overdue, By Status, By Phase.

export CSV/XLSX/PDF bundle.

SLA helpers

Visual badges for due soon/overdue based on Required Response Date.

Optional reminders (email/push) to Recipient and Distribution List.

5) iPhone app (and mobile web)

Login via the same credentials/SSO.

Project and RFI list scoped by user permissions.

Quick Create RFI

Take photo(s) or choose from gallery.

Auto-fill Date of Creation.

Drop-downs for common fields (Status defaults Open, Impacted Areas, Recipient list from project contacts).

Voice-to-text for Subject and Description.

Optional geotag and timestamp on photos.

Offline draft mode (store locally, sync when online).

Push notifications:

@mentions, responses posted, status changes, items due/overdue.

6) Permissions summary

Admin: CRUD companies, BUs, users, roles, projects, benchmarks, all RFIs and reports.

BUM: CRUD projects and RFIs within assigned BU(s); view AI reports; manage team assignments for those projects.

Employee: Create and comment RFIs on assigned projects; view project docs; cannot change project settings.

7) Contract benchmark + AI review workflow

Admin uploads or edits the Company Contract Benchmark template (structured: category > rule/benchmark > severity > suggested drafting).

User uploads a client contract file to the project and triggers “Run AI Review.”

System extracts text, compares to benchmarks, and produces:

Coverage table: benchmark vs contract evidence (clause refs, page links).

Risk classification: Compliant / Partial / Gap.

Suggested drafting where gaps exist (pulled from template; allow human edit).

Summary: top risks, payment/SOPA/BIFA exposure, program/EOT, security/defects, liability/insurance, termination/LDs.

User can accept, edit, and publish a Review Report (PDF + web view), versioned.

8) Core UI (web)

Login → Company switcher (if user belongs to multiple).

Admin: Company > BUs > Users > Benchmarks > Settings.

Within BU: Projects list (cards/table) with quick metrics (open RFIs, due RFIs, phase status).

Project: Tabs

Overview (phase dates timeline, key contacts, recent activity).

Contract Review (uploads, AI reports).

RFIs (register + New RFI).

Documents (files with tags).

Settings (team, numbering, integrations).

9) Data model (high level)

Company(id, name, abn?, timezone, logo_url)

BU(id, company_id, name, abn_or_unique)

User(id, name, email, role, status)

UserBU(user_id, bu_id)

Project(id, bu_id, project_id_code, name, phase, tender_start/end, delivery_start/end, closeout_start/end, status)

BenchmarkTemplate(id, company_id, version, items[…])

ContractUpload(id, project_id, filename, version, uploaded_by, processed_status)

ContractReview(id, project_id, upload_id, summary_json, pdf_url, created_by, created_at)

RFI(id, project_id, number_int, number_ref, title, to, description, refs, suggestion, impacts[], required_response_date, status, response, date_created, date_response, distribution[])

RFIComment(id, rfi_id, user_id, body, attachments[], created_at, parent_comment_id?)

Attachment(id, owner_type, owner_id, filename, mime, url, metadata)

AuditLog(id, actor_id, action, entity, entity_id, before, after, at)

10) Numbering logic

Per project, maintain rfi_next_number starting at 1.

On create, allocate and format: <ProjectID>-RFI-<zero-padded 4 digits>.

Prevent gaps by allocating on save; recycle only if creation fails.

11) Notifications

Email + push:

On new RFI (notify To + Distribution).

On comment or @mention.

48h before Required Response Date; on due; on overdue daily.

Digest option: daily/weekly summary by project/BU.

12) Search and reporting

Global search across projects, RFIs, clauses.

Filters by BU, project, status, dates, recipients.

Dashboards:

Open vs closed RFIs by project/BU.

Average response time.

Overdue count and aging.

Contract review risk heatmap.

13) Security, compliance, audit

Role-based access control, least privilege.

ABN field validation for AU format where applicable.

MFA optional, enforced by Admin setting.

Full audit trail on key entities (who changed what, when).

Data stored in AU region (if required).

File virus scan on upload.

Rate limiting, CSRF, TLS, salted password hashes (Argon2/bcrypt).

14) Integrations (optional/phase 2)

Email ingest: reply-by-email to an RFI thread.

SharePoint/OneDrive/Google Drive file links.

Calendar iCal feed for Required Response Dates.

Webhooks for ERP/PM tools.

15) Non-functional requirements

Responsive web app; iPhone app SwiftUI; mobile web supported.

Fast: RFI register loads <1s for 500 items, server-side pagination.

Availability target 99.9%.

Backups daily, retention 30–90 days.

Accessibility WCAG AA.

16) Admin settings

Company-wide defaults: numbering format, default RFI fields, required fields, SLA thresholds, reminder cadence.

Custom picklists: Impacted Areas, Phases, Recipient orgs.

User import template (CSV), with validation preview.

17) Acceptance criteria (high level)

Users can create company, BU with ABN, and import users with roles.

BUMs see only their BU projects; Admins see all; Employees see assigned projects.

Project phases and dates captured; timeline displays correctly.

Benchmark template upload works; AI review produces a variance report with clause refs and exportable PDF.

RFI auto-numbers from 1 per project; register filters/sorts; thread works with @mentions and attachments.

iPhone app can create an RFI with photo and drop-downs, and receive push notifications.

Reminders fire relative to Required Response Date.

Audit log records key events.

18) Nice touches to include early

One-click “Use last RFI values” to speed up similar RFIs.

Save any RFI as a template (pre-filled fields).

Quick link: “Convert RFI to Variation/EOT” (placeholder for future module).
