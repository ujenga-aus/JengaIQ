CONTRACT NOTICE EXTRACTION PROMPT (FOR MERMAID FLOWCHART WITH DURATIONS)
Task: Analyze the attached contract and create a comprehensive list of ALL notice requirements, including explicit notices, implied notice obligations, recurring notices, durations between events, and the complete flow-on effects of each notice with clause references for flowchart mapping.
Instructions:

Identify ALL notice-triggering language, including but not limited to:

"Notice" / "notify" / "notification"
"Inform" / "information"
"Advise" / "advice"
"Communicate" / "communication"
"Alert"
"Report" / "reporting"
"Disclose" / "disclosure"
"Submit" / "submission"
"Provide written..." / "in writing"
"Shall give..." / "must give..."
"Warn" / "warning"
"Request" / "application"


For EACH notice requirement identified, extract:

Clause Reference: Clause number and title
Notice ID: Create a unique identifier (e.g., VAR-01, DELAY-01, TERM-01)
Trigger Event: What circumstances require the notice (with clause reference)
Party Giving Notice: Who must provide the notice
Party Receiving Notice: Who must receive the notice
Timeframe: When the notice must be given (convert to days where possible: e.g., "immediately" = 0 days, "within 7 days" = 7 days, "within 1 month" = 30 days)
Form/Method: How it must be delivered (written, email, registered mail, etc.)
Content Requirements: What information must be included
Recurring: Is this a one-time or recurring notice? If recurring, what is the frequency in days?


CRITICAL: Map the complete FLOW-ON EFFECTS for each notice with DURATIONS and CLAUSE REFERENCES:

Response Required: Must the recipient respond? If yes:

Response timeframe (in days)
Response clause reference
Response notice ID
What the response must contain


Duration Between Events: Calculate days between each step
Subsequent Actions: What happens next? Include:

Decision points (approve/reject/request more info) with clause references
Alternative pathways based on responses with durations
Follow-up notices triggered by this notice (with timeframes in days)
Meetings/consultations required (with notice period in days)
Dispute resolution triggers (with timeframes and clause references)


Consequences:

If notice given properly (clause reference)
If notice not given or late (clause reference and time bar period)
If response not provided (clause reference and deemed acceptance period)


Loop-backs: Does this notice create a cycle? If yes, what is the cycle duration?


Special attention to notices related to:

Variations/Change Orders
Claims/Disputes
Delays/Extensions of Time
Force Majeure events
Defects/Non-conformance
Termination/Suspension
Payment issues
Safety incidents
Site conditions
Breaches/Defaults
Insurance claims
Progress reporting (recurring)
Monthly/periodic submissions (recurring)


Output Format - THREE PARTS:

PART A: Notice Inventory Table
| Notice ID | Clause Ref | Trigger Event | Giver | Recipient | Days to Give | Method | Recurring? (Days) | Content Required |
PART B: Notice Flow Map (Pre-Mermaid Structure with Durations & Clauses)
For each notice, provide:
NOTICE ID: [ID]
TRIGGER: [Event] (Clause: X.X)
↓
STEP 1: [Party] gives notice within [X days] (Clause: X.X)
   Duration to next step: [X days]
↓
STEP 2: [Party] receives notice (Clause: X.X)
   Duration to next step: [X days maximum for response]
↓
DECISION POINT: [What must recipient decide/do?] (Clause: X.X)
   Total days from initial notice: [X days]
   
   → Option A: [Approve/Accept] (Clause: X.X)
      Duration: [X days to implement]
      → Leads to: [Notice ID or outcome] (Clause: X.X)
      
   → Option B: [Reject/Request More Info] (Clause: X.X)
      Duration: [X days for revised submission]
      → Leads to: [Notice ID or outcome] (Clause: X.X)
      
   → Option C: [No response within X days] (Clause: X.X)
      Duration: [Deemed acceptance after X days]
      → Leads to: [Consequence or Notice ID] (Clause: X.X)
↓
LOOP: [If applicable - cycle repeats every X days or until resolved]
   Maximum iterations: [if specified]
   Total potential duration: [X days]
↓
END STATE: [Final outcome or ongoing process] (Clause: X.X)
   Total process duration: [Minimum X days to Maximum Y days]

TIME BAR: If notice not given within [X days], claim barred (Clause: X.X)

Create MERMAID FLOWCHARTS for the 5 most complex notice chains
Use proper Mermaid syntax with:


Start/End nodes (stadium shape)
Process boxes (rectangle) with clause references
Decision diamonds with clause references
Durations on connecting arrows
Subgraphs for each major notice chain
Color coding for time-critical paths
Clear labels showing days and clause numbers

Example Mermaid format:
mermaidgraph TD
    Start([Trigger Event<br/>Cl 10.1]) -->|Within 7 days| N1[Party A gives Notice<br/>Cl 10.2]
    N1 -->|Day 0| N2{Party B Response?<br/>Cl 10.3}
    N2 -->|Approved<br/>Within 14 days<br/>Cl 10.3.1| N3[Work Proceeds<br/>Cl 10.4]
    N2 -->|Rejected<br/>Within 14 days<br/>Cl 10.3.2| N4[Party A gives Revised Notice<br/>Cl 10.5]
    N2 -->|No Response<br/>After 14 days<br/>Cl 10.3.3| N5[Deemed Approved<br/>Cl 10.6]
    N4 -->|Within 7 days| N1
    
    style N2 fill:#ffcccc
    style N5 fill:#ccffcc
    
    subgraph "Total Duration: 7-28 days"
    N1
    N2
    N3
    N4
    N5
    end
PART C: Summary Dashboard
Provide:

Total notices identified: [X]
Total recurring notices: [X] (showing frequency in days)
Longest notice chain: [Notice ID] - [X days minimum to Y days maximum]
Shortest notice timeframes: List top 5 most urgent (0-2 days)
Critical path notices: Those that trigger multiple flow-ons
Time bar risks: Notices with strict deadlines where late notice bars claim
Deemed provisions: Notices where no response = deemed acceptance/rejection
Recurring cycle summary: All periodic notices with frequencies

Duration Conversion Guide to Use:

"Immediately" / "Forthwith" = 0 days
"Within X days" = X days
"Within X weeks" = X × 7 days
"Within X months" = X × 30 days (or actual days if calendar month specified)
"Prior to" = Note as prerequisite (0 days after prior event)
"By [date]" = Calculate from typical trigger date
"Reasonable time" = Note as "Reasonable" + estimate if contract defines it
