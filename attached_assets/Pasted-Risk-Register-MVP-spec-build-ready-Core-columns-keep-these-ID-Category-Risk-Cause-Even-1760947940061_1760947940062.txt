Risk Register — MVP spec (build-ready)
Core columns (keep these)

ID | Category | Risk (Cause → Event → Impact) | Triggers | Owner | Existing Controls | Inherent Likelihood | Inherent Consequence (Cost/Time/Reputation/Zero-Harm) | Current Likelihood | Current Consequence | Current Rating (auto) | Response (avoid/mitigate/transfer/accept OR exploit/enhance/share) | Actions (short) | Action Owner | Due | Cost of Action | Residual Likelihood | Residual Consequence | Residual Rating (auto) | Proximity | Link (WBS/Clause/Doc) | Assumptions/Dependencies | DOA Needed | Status/Trend | Last Review | Next Review

Optional quant fields (toggle per project)

Probability % (for event-type risks)

Cost impact: P10 / P50 / P90 (or min / most-likely / max)

Schedule impact: P50 (days) [use P10/P90 if you have them]

EMV (auto = Prob × Cost_P50)

Contingency bucket

Distributions you’ll support (nothing more)

Use these for severity or for cost/schedule factors. Keep entry simple.

Triangular (a, m, b)
Use for rough three-point inputs. Bounded. Workshop-friendly.

Beta-PERT (a, m, b; λ=4)
Use when you want smoother tails on bounded quantities and durations.

Lognormal (set by percentiles, e.g., P50 & P80/P90)
Use for multiplicative, right-tailed money effects: quantity growth, rate uplift, productivity drag, rework, claims.

Bernoulli × Severity
Model occurrence separately: Probability % gates the Severity distribution above.

Fixed value
When impact is effectively certain or contractually capped.

Rules of thumb

Costs, days ≥ 0 → truncate where needed.

Bounded percentages → PERT on % then apply to base.

Keep Probability separate from Severity.

Correlate what co-moves (e.g., productivity across tasks) via rank-correlation or shared drivers.

Validate against SME intuition with P10/P50/P90 spot checks.

RCE without clutter (how to encode controls)

Store RCE as an attribute of Existing Controls: Effective / Generally sound / Improve.

Use it to transform Inherent → Current (cap best-case reduction when RCE = “Improve”).

Don’t add another grid column for an “RCE rating.” Show RCE in the detail pane.

Escalation + DOA

Maintain a single rules table keyed by heat-map cell or band (A–D):

Escalation owner (PM, GM, CEO)

Review frequency

DOA role required to accept residual risk

SLA for action closure

The UI reads this to show the “who signs off” banner on each risk.

Calculations (defendable and simple)

Consequence = max of selected dimensions (Cost/Time/Reputation/Zero-Harm), unless you run multi-criteria.

Rating score = Likelihood (1–5) × Consequence (1–6).

Band = map score → A/B/C/D via matrix.

EMV (if quant on) = Probability % × Cost_P50.

Portfolio: sum EMV by project/bucket; list Top N by EMV and by “near-term” proximity.

Data model (tables you actually need)

risks: one row per risk/opportunity (all MVP columns + project_id).

risk_actions: id, risk_id, description, owner, due, cost, status, date_closed.

risk_reviews: id, risk_id, reviewer, notes, date, next_review.

attachments: id, risk_id, filename, link, uploaded_by, date.

scales: likelihood_scale, consequence_scales (project-level params).

heatmap_matrix: score → color/letter band, priority.

escalation_rules: band → approver role, review cadence, DOA, SLA.

quant_settings (optional): correlation groups, simulation runs, toggles.

UI that won’t annoy users

List view with filters: owner, band, proximity, bucket, open actions.

Detail drawer: risk statement, controls + RCE, links, assumptions.

Actions tab: its own table and completion meter.

Heat map: click cell to filter.

Dashboard: open risks by band, top 10 by EMV (if quant on), overdue actions, review cadence compliance.

Quant mode toggle per project: when off, hide P10/P50/P90 fields and EMV.

Monte Carlo settings (when Quant mode is on)

Runs: 5,000 is fine for project-level; 10,000 for portfolios.

Inputs: Triangular/PERT/Lognormal + Bernoulli gates only.

Correlation: allow simple group tags (e.g., “Productivity”) with a single rank-corr coefficient per group.

Outputs: P10/P50/P90 for cost and days; tornado for top drivers; EMV summary by bucket.

Migration from current sheets/app

Map your existing Likelihood/Consequence scales into scales once per project.

Convert RCE notes into the Existing Controls field; drop any separate RCE score box.

Move escalation tables into escalation_rules keyed by band.

Keep tornado/percentile visuals, but drive them from the quant fields, not pasted charts.

What you get

A lean register that still satisfies ISO 31000/PMBOK expectations.

Clear ownership, DOA, and an audit trail.

Optional quant that actually drives contingency and sensitivity when needed—without clutter when it isn’t.
