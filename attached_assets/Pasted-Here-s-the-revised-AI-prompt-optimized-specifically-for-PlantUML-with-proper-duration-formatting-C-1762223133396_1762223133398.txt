Here's the revised AI prompt optimized specifically for PlantUML with proper duration formatting:

CONTRACT NOTICE EXTRACTION PROMPT (FOR PLANTUML FLOWCHART WITH DURATIONS)
Task: Analyze the attached contract and create a comprehensive list of ALL notice requirements, including explicit notices, implied notice obligations, recurring notices, durations between events, and the complete flow-on effects of each notice with clause references for PlantUML flowchart generation.
Instructions:

Identify ALL notice-triggering language, including but not limited to:

"Notice" / "notify" / "notification"
"Inform" / "information"
"Advise" / "advice"
"Communicate" / "communication"
"Alert"
"Report" / "reporting"
"Disclose" / "disclosure"
"Submit" / "submission"
"Provide written..." / "in writing"
"Shall give..." / "must give..."
"Warn" / "warning"
"Request" / "application"


For EACH notice requirement identified, extract:

Clause Reference: Clause number and title
Notice ID: Create a unique identifier (e.g., VAR-01, DELAY-01, TERM-01)
Trigger Event: What circumstances require the notice (with clause reference)
Party Giving Notice: Who must provide the notice (use consistent party names)
Party Receiving Notice: Who must receive the notice (use consistent party names)
Duration to Give Notice: Days from trigger event (NUMBER ONLY: e.g., 7, 14, 0, 30)
Form/Method: How it must be delivered
Content Requirements: What information must be included
Recurring: One-time or recurring? If recurring, frequency in days (NUMBER ONLY)


CRITICAL: Map FLOW-ON EFFECTS with EXPLICIT DURATIONS (NUMBERS ONLY) and CLAUSE REFERENCES:

Response Required: Must the recipient respond? If yes:

Response timeframe: [NUMBER] days (e.g., 14 days, not "within 14 days")
Response clause reference
Response notice ID
What response must contain


Duration Between Each Step: Specify as [NUMBER] days only
Subsequent Actions with Durations:

Decision points with timeframes: [NUMBER] days
Alternative pathways: [NUMBER] days for each path
Follow-up notices: [NUMBER] days to issue
Meetings/consultations: [NUMBER] days notice required
Dispute resolution: [NUMBER] days at each stage


Consequences with Time Bars:

Time bar period: [NUMBER] days (if claim barred after this period)
Deemed acceptance/rejection: [NUMBER] days of no response


Loop-backs: Cycle duration in days (NUMBER ONLY)


Special attention to notices related to:

Variations/Change Orders
Claims/Disputes
Delays/Extensions of Time
Force Majeure events
Defects/Non-conformance
Termination/Suspension
Payment issues
Safety incidents
Site conditions
Breaches/Defaults
Insurance claims
Progress reporting (recurring)
Monthly/periodic submissions (recurring)


Output Format - THREE PARTS:

PART A: Notice Inventory Table
| Notice ID | Clause | Trigger Event | Giver | Recipient | Days to Give (NUMBER) | Method | Recurring Days (NUMBER) | Content Required |
PART B: Structured Notice Flow for PlantUML
For each notice, provide in this EXACT format:
NOTICE_ID: VAR-01
CLAUSE: 10.2
TRIGGER: Discovery of varied work required
GIVER: Contractor
RECIPIENT: Principal

TIMELINE:
Day 0: Trigger event occurs (Clause 10.1)
Day [X]: Contractor issues Variation Notice (Clause 10.2)
  |
  +---> Duration to response: [NUMBER] days (Clause 10.3)
  |
Day [X+Y]: Principal must respond (Clause 10.3)

DECISION_BRANCHES:
Branch A: Approve (Clause 10.3.1)
  - Duration to implement: [NUMBER] days
  - Leads to: Work proceeds (Clause 10.4)
  - Total elapsed: [NUMBER] days
  
Branch B: Reject (Clause 10.3.2)
  - Duration to resubmit: [NUMBER] days
  - Leads to: VAR-01 (revised) - LOOP
  - Total elapsed: [NUMBER] days
  
Branch C: Request more information (Clause 10.3.3)
  - Duration to provide info: [NUMBER] days
  - Leads to: Additional submission (Clause 10.3.4)
  - Then returns to Day [X] decision
  - Total elapsed: [NUMBER] days

Branch D: No response (Clause 10.3.5)
  - After [NUMBER] days: Deemed approved
  - Leads to: Work proceeds (Clause 10.6)
  - Total elapsed: [NUMBER] days

TIME_BAR: [NUMBER] days from trigger (Clause 10.7)
If notice not given within [NUMBER] days, claim is barred.

TOTAL_DURATION:
Minimum: [NUMBER] days (fastest path)
Maximum: [NUMBER] days (slowest path with loops)
Average: [NUMBER] days (typical path)

**PART D: PlantUML Data Table for Each Notice**
Provide this structured data that PlantUML can parse:
```
NOTICE: VAR-01

Fastest/Slowest notice chains

Duration Standardization Rules:
Convert all timeframes to NUMBERS (days only):

"Immediately" / "Forthwith" = 0
"Within X days" = X
"Within X business days" = X (note if business days)
"Within X weeks" = [X × 7]
"Within 1 month" = 30
"Within X months" = [X × 30]
"Prior to [event]" = 0 (relative to that event)
"Reasonable time" = Note as "TBD" + estimate if contract defines
"As soon as practicable" = "ASAP" + estimate from context

Always express durations as:

Absolute day number from trigger (e.g., "Day 7", "Day 21")
Duration between events (e.g., "Duration: 14 days")
Total elapsed time (e.g., "Total: 35 days")
